- Write a blog post about what you learned
- Contribute to one open-source project (even documentation)

### Monthly
- Build one complete feature from scratch
- Deploy one project to production
- Learn from one senior developer's code (GitHub exploration)

## üéØ **Success Metrics**

### After Month 3, you should be able to:
- Build a CRUD API from scratch in 2-3 hours
- Design a database schema for any simple application
- Debug TypeScript/NestJS errors confidently

### After Month 6, you should be able to:
- Architect a scalable backend system
- Integrate with external APIs and services
- Deploy and monitor a production application
- Use AI coding assistants effectively (because you understand the fundamentals)

---

## üö® **Important Notes**

### Don't Skip Steps
Each month builds on the previous. Don't rush to advanced topics.

### Focus on Understanding, Not Just Coding
- Ask "why" for every pattern you use
- Understand the trade-offs of your decisions
- Learn to debug systematically

### Build Real Projects
- Each project should solve a real problem
- Deploy your projects (even if basic)
- Get feedback from other developers

### Prepare for AI-Assisted Coding
By Month 6, you'll have enough foundation to:
- Understand AI-generated code
- Debug AI suggestions effectively
- Know when AI is wrong
- Combine AI assistance with your solid fundamentals

---

## üéâ **The End Goal**

After 6 months, when you start using AI coding assistants, you won't be blindly copying code. You'll be a developer who:
- Understands what the AI is suggesting
- Can modify and improve AI-generated code
- Knows when to reject AI suggestions
- Can architect systems that AI can help you implement

**Remember:** The goal isn't to avoid AI, but to be skilled enough to use it effectively. AI amplifies your existing skills - so build those skills first!
